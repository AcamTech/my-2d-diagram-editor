<!--
  Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house our grid system.
  You may choose one of two containers, container or container-fluid to use in your projects.
  Note that, due to padding and more, neither container is nestable.
-->

<!-- <div class="container"> -->

<!--
  Notice the single quotes inside the double quotes. The single quotes tell AngularJS that
  the value passed to it is a string literal, not a variable.
